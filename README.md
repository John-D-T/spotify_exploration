# README
The 'spotify_exploration' project's purpose is to explore musical data. Here we use the Spotify API to aid with analysis, and focus on using the 'polars' package to process our data.

Ideas include:
Exploring the popularity of genres over time, and digging into defining characteristics of songs by decade.

Generating a module which can parse hip-hop song lyrics and decipher rhyme schemes. This may require auxiliary rhyme 
dictionaries, or even potentially a personally generated dictionary.


Note: This project would not be possible with the help of Spotify and their API, accessible using 'Spotify for Developers':
