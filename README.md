# README
The 'spotify_exploration' repository's purpose is to explore song data. Using the Spotify API to aid with analysis.

Ideas include:
Exploring the popularity of genres over time, and digging into defining characteristics of songs by decade.

Generating a module which can parse hip-hop song lyrics and decipher rhyme schemes. This may require auxiliary rhyme 
dictionaries, or even potentially a personally generated dictionary.


Note: This project would not be possible with the help of Spotify and their API, accessible using 'Spotify for Developers':

**Currently using Python Version 3.8**
